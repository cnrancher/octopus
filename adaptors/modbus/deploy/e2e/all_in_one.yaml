    devices.edge.cattle.io/description: Modbus is a communication protocol developed
      by Modicon system. In short, it is a method for transmitting information between
      electronic devices through a serial line. The Modbus protocol is a master-slave
      architecture protocol. The Modbus adapter can be called a Modbus master station
      and is responsible for connecting and collecting information from Modbus slave
      stations (i.e, devices).
